        <h1>Japanese - An example approach</h1>

        <h2>1. Characters & Vocabulary (1 year)</h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/">WaniKani</a> is an a web and mobile flashcard app that teaches you 2000 Kanji characters and 
            5000 vocabulary words, split among 60 levels. I stopped at level 50, giving me around 1600 characters and 5000 vocabulary words. 
            This took me 380 days to complete, studying 30-60 minutes a day.
        </p>

        <p class="image-subtitle">I mostly studied on the train to work in the morning</p>

        <h2>2. Grammar (2 months)</h2>

        <p>
            I started learning Grammar after I had learned about 500 Kanji characters and 1500 vocabulary words.
        </p>

        <p>
            I bought a Grammar text book (Genki 1 & 2). I ignored all exercises and quizzes. Instead the goal is to capture the example sentences as flashcards. 
            I downloaded the <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki flashcard app</a> and made a flashcard for each example sentence (I made 1 card per grammar point).
        </p>
        <p>
            You can go through an entire textbook in 2-3 weeks easily this way. I did the same thing for another two textbooks to look for any grammar points I 
            that were not covered in the first textbook. I went back and made additional flashcards for Grammar points I was having trouble remembering.
        </p>

        <img src="img/grammar.png" />
        <p class="image-subtitle">I tried to cover about 5-10 grammar points (5-10 flashcards) a day. I ended up with around 600 flashcards</p>
        
        <h2>3. Beginning reading with Manga (1 year) </h2>

        <p>
            After I had finished explicitly studying Grammar, About 5 months into studying Japanese, I started reading Manga.
        </p>

        <p>
            While reading, I looked out for sentences that I *almost* understood minus one thing, and made a flashcard for that one thing.
            As with all my sentence flashcards, the format is the same: sentence on the front, explanation on the back.
        </p>

        <p>
            I aimed to finish one volume a month to start with, and then 2 a month after I was more comfortable. a volume is typically about 200 pages.
        </p>

        <p class="image-subtitle">Only back of flashcards depicted. The front is just the sentence.</p>

        <h2>4. Reading Light Novels </h2>

        <p>
            After I had finished reading 20 volumes of Manga, I started reading light novels.
        </p>

        <p>
            I mostly read light novels on the web, using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan/ogmnaimimemjmbakcfefmnahgdfhfami">YomiChan</a> 
            browser add-on that shows dictionary definitions when you hover over words in Japanese. It also has a feature to export to Anki.
        </p>

        <p>
            I created sentence flashcards in the same way I did for Manga, looking for sentences where I don't understand one thing, and
            creating a flashcard for that one thing. Sentence on the front, explanation on the back.
        </p>

        <img src="img/novels.png" />
        <p class="image-subtitle">Exactly the same flashcard format as for Manga.</p>

        <h2>5. Consuming media content with MPV Player and MPVacious </h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://mpv.io/">MPV Player</a> together with the <a href="https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious">MPVacious plugin</a> lets you create 
            flashcards automatically from movies or tv shows. It takes the current subtitle, screenshot and audio clip and brings it in as an Anki card. The one 
            limitation is that you must have access to a standalone subtitle file, and video file. You can usually find subtitle files on various Subtitle database 
            websites. MPV+MPVacious+Yomichan+Anki is an amazing workflow that lets me create flashcards in a couple of seconds easily. Setup is non-trivial
            however.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a slightly different format for cards I take from TV/Movies. Each flashcard I create has two different forms;
        </p>

        <p>
            1. The first form has the sentence on the front, and then on the back it has the sentence, audio, screenshot and explanation.
        </p>

        <p>
            2. The second form has only the audio on the front (nothing else). The back then has the sentence, screenshot and explanation.
        </p>

        <p>
            This means for every flashcard I am testing myself on being able to understand when I read it, and hear it.
        </p>

        <h2>7. A few more tips on flashcards</h2>

        <p>
            1. I try to make 5-10 cards a day. 
        </p>

        <p>
            2. My early cards have the sentence in English on the back as a crutch, but you should stop doing this as soon as you are comfortable.
        </p>

        <p>
            3. Every time I made a new flashcard I looked up the definition in a Japanese-only dictionary. If I understood it, I would put
            the definition in Japanese on the back of the card instead of English. As I got better, it meant that the majority of my new cards
            have no English on them at all.
