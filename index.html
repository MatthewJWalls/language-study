        <h1>My approach to Language Study</h1>

        <p>
            This is a breakdown of my process for learning Japanese, which I started in 2017. I have tried to keep it short and practical, 
            but there is <a href="#theory" class="inner">a theory section at the bottom</a> with some notes about the process itself.
        </p>
      
        <p>
            This was my third attempt to learn the language. The first two attempts were complete failures and I gave up after a month or
            two.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Learning the Kana</h2>

        <p>
            Kana are the foundational characters of the laguage; consisting of Hiragana and Katakana. At about 46 characters in each set, it doesn't 
            take too long to learn. I skipped the common beginner's practice of using <em>romaji</em> (Japanese written in the latin alphabet) and 
            started straight with the Kana.
        </p>

        <p>
            I used a site called <a href="https://realkana.com/">RealKana</a>. Starting with the Hiragana, I drilled myself on the first column in 
            isolation until I stopped making mistakes, then the second column in isolation, then both columns at once before moving on to the third column, 
            and so on slowly incorporating all the columns until I had the entire set down. Then I repeated the process for the Katakana. This took me 
            about three days.
        </p>

        <p>
            I would recommend immediately moving on to learning the Kanji after finishing the Kana. You will naturally review all your Kana *while* 
            learning the Kanji.
        </p>
        

        <h2>2. Kanji & Vocabulary</h2>

        <p>
            The internet disagrees a lot about the best way to learn the Kanji characters. Here's what worked for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://www.wanikani.com/">WaniKani</a> is a web and mobile flashcard app that teaches you 2000 Kanji characters and 
            5000 vocabulary words, split among 60 levels, and is how I learned all my basic Kanji and Vocabulary. I stopped at level 50, 
            giving me around 1600 characters and 5000 vocabulary words. This took me 380 days to complete, studying 30-60 minutes a day.
        </p>

        <p>
            To <em>very briefly</em> talk about the pros and cons of WaniKani - WaniKani is polished, welcoming, and feels more like a game
            than a chore. It's one of the more time consuming ways to learn the Kanji characters, but I think the average person has a better 
            chance of actually finishing WaniKani than other more 'optimal' methods.
        </p>
          
        <p>
            I did notice one major problem with WaniKani however; it was very tempting to feel like I was 'done' with my daily studies just
            because I had finished my flashcards on WaniKani, and many days I neglected actually bothering to read or listen to any real language 
            because I had finished my cards. This might not have been a problem, except WaniKani takes
            <em>over a year</em> to finish, and neglecting listening and reading for a whole year isn't a good idea.
        </p>          
          
        <p>
            Other methods such as doing 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmXzslAGkCI"> RTK with Anki </a> is probably more efficient for dedicated learners, 
            because you finish it more quickly (3-6 months), and are therefore forced to start reading and listening earlier, but it feels more like
            a chore.
        </p>

        <p class="image-subtitle">I mostly studied on the train to work in the morning</p>

        <h2>3. Grammar</h2>

        <p>
            I started Grammar after I had learned about 500 Kanji characters and 1500 vocabulary words.
        </p>

        <p>
            I bought a Grammar textbook (Genki 1 & 2). My approach to Grammar is to rapidly work through the textbook, turning the example sentences into flashcards, 
            ignoring all exercises and quizzes. I downloaded the <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki flashcard app</a> and made a flashcard for each grammar point 
            from an example sentence that was given.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>You can go through an entire textbook in 2-3 weeks easily this way</strong>. After finishing Genki 1 and 2, I did the same thing for another
            two textbooks (Tae Kim & Tobira) to look for any grammar points that were not covered in Genki. I went back and made additional flashcards 
            for Grammar points I was having trouble remembering.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea of skipping all the exercises might surprise you. There is a more detailed explanation of why I think this is a good approach in the Theory section
            at the bottom of this page.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't want to spend any money, the <a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/">Tae Kim Grammar Guide</a> is very good and arguably better than
            Genki for self learners.
        </p>

        <p class="image-subtitle">Turning my grammar textbook into flashcards. I ended up with ~400 flashcards, making 5-10 a day</p>
        
        <h2>4. Reading Manga </h2>

        <p>
            After I had finished explicitly studying Grammar, About 5 months into studying Japanese, I started reading Manga.
        </p>

        <p>
            While reading, I looked out for sentences that I *almost* understood, minus one thing, and made a flashcard for that one thing. This is called the 'i+1
            approach'; where 'i' is what you know, and the +1 is the one extra thing that you don't. You are looking for sentences that are i+1.
        </p>
        <p>
            As with all my sentence flashcards, the format is the same: sentence on the front, explanation on the back.
        </p>

        <p>
            I aimed to finish one volume a month to start with, and then two a month after I was more comfortable. a volume is typically about 200 pages.
        </p>

        <img src="img/manga.png" alt="picture showing me turning sentences in Manga into Anki flashcards" />
        <p class="image-subtitle">Sentence cards from Manga. Only the back is depicted. The front is just the sentence alone.</p>

        <h2>5. Reading Light Novels </h2>

        <p>
            After I had finished reading 20 volumes of Manga, I started reading light novels.
        </p>

        <p>
            I mostly read light novels on the web, using the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yomichan/ogmnaimimemjmbakcfefmnahgdfhfami">Yomichan</a> 
            browser add-on that shows dictionary definitions when you hover over words in Japanese. It also has a feature to export to Anki.
        </p>

        <p>
            I created sentence flashcards in the same way I did for Manga, looking for sentences where I don't understand one thing, and
            creating a flashcard for that one thing. Sentence on the front, explanation on the back.
        </p>

        <img src="img/novels.png" alt="picture showing me turning sentences in Light Novels into Anki flashcards using the Yomichan browser plugin"/>
        <p class="image-subtitle">Exactly the same flashcard format as for Manga.</p>

        <h2>6. Consuming media content with MPV Player and MPVacious </h2>

        <p>
            <a href="https://mpv.io/">MPV Player</a> is a media player somewhat like VLC, except more configurable. Watching media like Anime or TV shows in 
            MPV Player, combined with the <a href="https://github.com/Ajatt-Tools/mpvacious">MPVacious plugin</a> gives you the ability create flashcards 
            with embedded audio automatically from movies or tv shows. With one button press, it takes the current subtitle, screenshot and audio clip 
            and creates an Anki flashcard. You can even hook it up with Yomichan to include dictionary definitions as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The one limitation is that you must have access to a standalone subtitle file, and video file. You can usually find subtitle files on various <a href="https://kitsunekko.net/">Subtitle database 
            websites</a>. MPV+MPVacious+Yomichan+Anki is an amazing workflow that lets me create flashcards in a couple of seconds easily. Setup is non-trivial
            however. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbg6ztWecbU">There is a video here about how to set up the basics.</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            I have a slightly different format for flashcards I take from TV/Movies. Each card I create has two different forms;

            <ol>
                <li>The first form has the written sentence on the front, and then on the back it has the audio, screenshot and explanation.</li>
                <li>The second form has only the audio on the front (nothing else). The back then has the sentence, screenshot and explanation.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            This means for every flashcard, I am testing myself separately on being able to read it, and hear it.
        </p>

        <p class="image-subtitle">Only first form of these flashcards are depicted.</p>

        <h2>7. Putting everything together</h2>

        <p>To summarise what my study journey actually looked like in practice</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I Studied Kanji with Vocabulary in isolation until I had about 500 Kanji/1500 Vocabulary words.</li>
            <li>I began to incorporate a grammar textbook; which I went through rapidly using a sentence-based flashcard approach.</li>
            <li>When I had finished my grammar textbooks, I started trying to read Manga, and watch anime with Japanese subtitles. I brought appropriate sentences into Anki, making 5-10 cards a day.</li>
            <li>I graduated to reading Light Novels after reading 20 volumes of manga.</li>
            <li>I ended up reading 24 light novels by the end of my third year.</li>
            <li>I neglected listening for the first couple of years, but I eventually started consistently watching about five 25-minute episodes of Anime and Drama every day.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="img/timeline.png" style="max-width: 688px" alt="Picture showing the timeline of my Japanese study, summarising what I said in the previous paragraph."/>
        <p class="image-subtitle">Rough timeline of what I did.</p>

        <h2>8. Where I am now</h2>

        <p>
            As I stand now, I can read Manga easily, and light novels comfortably at a decent pace. I still need to look up words almost every page, 
            but so few that it's almost never a barrier to comprehension. My listening ability lags behind quite a bit, because I prioritised reading so much, but I can understand 
            Anime, Twitch etc fine. I have a bit more trouble with drama and fast-paced youtube videos.
        <p>
            I currently have about 9000 flashcards in total, but I probably know an equal amount of words as that passively without ever bothering to 
            make a flashcard for it.
        </p>

        <p>I'm spending my time now improving my listening skills, and starting to output (write and speak).</p>

        Here's my Anki review heatmap, including all the big gaps where I got lazy:

        <img src="img/heatmap.png" style="max-width: 688px" alt="Picture of my Anki review heatmap from 2017 to 2021" />
        <p class="image-subtitle">The gaps are where I got sick, had a family emergency, or got addicted to a new game.</p>

        <h2>Appendix - Advice</h2>

        <h3>Motivation and study habits</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Learning a language to an advanced level takes a huge time investment, on the order of hours a day, every day, for <em>years</em>.
                Be realistic and plan your goals accordingly. It's completely OK to have a goal just to get to a basic conversational level and maintain it there, but if 
                you want to go beyond this, you'll need to put in the time.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you have trouble keeping up a consistent study habit every day, a good approach is to narrow your focus - do just one small
                thing, but do it every day. When I first started, I only tried to do one thing - Kanji study on my morning commute - for a couple of months to 
                build up a habit without worrying about grammar, reading etc. Then when I'd built up the habit, I started to layer in Grammar study
                and reading slowly over time.
            </li>
            <li>There is the concept of "habit stacking". Taken from jamesclear.com: "One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current
                 habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top." An example from my life is that I read novels in Japanese every time 
                 I sit down to eat at my lunch break at work. The base daily habit was eating over lunch break, and on top of it I stacked reading practice.
            </li>
            <li>I highly recommend keeping a study diary where you can record your thoughts and milestones.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Flashcards and Anki</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Although pre-made Anki decks do exist, I recommend avoiding them and making your own. You will remember the content better this way.
                Although, if you are not using WaniKani then it is probably acceptable to go through a small pre-made vocabulary deck before doing grammar.
            </li>
            <li>I try to make 5-10 cards a day. </li>
            <li>My early cards have the sentence in English on the back as a crutch, but you should stop doing this as soon as you are comfortable.</li>
            <li>Once I started reading light novels, every time I made a new flashcard I looked up the definition in a Japanese-only dictionary. 
                If I understood it, I would put the definition in Japanese on the back of the card instead of English. As I got better, it meant that 
                the majority of my new cards have no English on them at all.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Regrets</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>I made a mistake in focusing too heavily on reading for the first three years. If I could go back, I would make sure I watched at least
                an hour or two of Anime/Drama every day.</li>
        </ol>

        <a id="theory"></a>
        <h2>Appendix - Process Theory</h2>

        <p>
            My approach is largely based on *the input hypothesis* by linguist Stephen Krashen. The Input Hypothesis states that language
            is acquired through repeated, constant exposure to the language (immersion), and not through speaking, writing or doing workbook exercises. As such, 
            I spent zero time doing conjugation drills, fill-in-the-blank quizzes, roleplaying exercises or anything else like that. Instead, my goal is 
            to start reading and listening as soon as possible, not to spend too much time on grammar, and use Anki flashcards as a safety net that ensures 
            repeated exposure to grammar patterns and vocabulary regularly.
        </p>
